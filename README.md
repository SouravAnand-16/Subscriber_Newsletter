## Technical Constraints

- **Backend:** Utilized Node.js and Express.js
- **Frontend:**  implemented using Vanilla HTML, CSS, JS. The frontend files could also be served directly from the server.
- **Database:** No dedicated database was required; data was stored locally.

## Problem Statement

The task was to develop a newsletter sending application using the MERN stack. The application included an email input field and a "Send Newsletter" button. Upon entering an email address and submitting it, a dummy newsletter was sent to the specified email address.

## Functional Requirements

1. Created a user interface with an input field for entering the email address.
2. Implemented functionality to validate the email address format before submission.
3. Provided a "Send Newsletter" button that triggered the sending of the dummy newsletter.
4. Upon submission, simulated the sending of a newsletter to the specified email address.
5. Ensured error handling for invalid email addresses or failed sending attempts.
6. Displayed feedback to the user on the sending status (success or failure).
7. Stored details of sent newsletters (e.g., recipient email, timestamp) locally for future reference.

## Conclusion

This application successfully demonstrated the basic functionalities of a newsletter system using the MERN stack, focusing on the simplicity of user interactions and local storage management without the complexity of a dedicated database.
